Change this set of prompts into one large LLM prompt that will help an LLM accurately and fully generate a working PHP project utilizing best practices and leaning into dependencies as long as they are still well-maintained and recommended by professionals. Do not make any of the things I want to make, nor make any charts nor use any html nor markdown, etc--simply write a shortened version of my prompts in simple text form that am LLM can easily digest as a single large one-paragraph prompt. Do not use nor mention Python nor Go, rely in PHP for the server software. Assume any instructions later in the document are more accurate than prior instructions that conflict. Utilize OpenAPI and Swagger or whatever OpenAPI software integrates best with the PHP project. The list of prompts is everything I say after this colon in this chat message: I want to make something like the worldeditsync plugin for Minecraft which synchronizes the clipboard of worldedit between two Minecraft servers. The change I want to make is that a passive service is running on a third server so that the plugin doesn't require any kludges to pass data between servers (It currently requires bungie cord or velocity). Is there existing server software I can use that can passively enqueue packets? It may be a web service as simple as doing CRUD on arbitrary data, with authentication of some sort (preferably Minecraft authentication to make it easier, but maybe you can find a dependency I can add that could provide that, such as a module for Python, Node.js, or other).

Ok, show how to do it in Python. Every copy operation should save clipboard data to a historical table and saved to disk. The Minecraft UUID of the user initiating the operation should be stored in the table for basic control of who sees what. Store the date, and an optional description string field that may or may not be set by the web api caller. Also save a unique id. Make a web api command that lists all entries for the authenticated Minecraft UUID, showing the unique id, date, and description for each (but does not get clipboard data blob if the list command is used). A separate simple clipboard get endpoint should get the entry with the highest id unless the request specifies an id (in either case, include the data blob in the reply).

I don't want the user to login, I just want to validate the user is logged into mojang such as with their official Minecraft client and somehow validate identity, like mojang's server does. I can provide whatever token/info is necessary by writing a bukkit plugin that will communicate with the relay server, and that addon's identity data as json is all the relay should validate.

What would be minimal implementations of the Java methods which would accept that info as args and interface with the Python service?

Ok, rewrite it in Go, using Go best practices for how to setup a web api with shared cache of the storage in memory so there isn't database thrashing. Also use Go best practices for setting up the directory structure, multiple code files if that is best, and metadata files(s). Be sure to note what the path of each file is relative to the base of the repo. Script any git/GitHub actions that would be helpful, including tests with mocking, and build-on-release for multiple platforms.

Yes, and be sure to show how to add the test status for each platform and architecture combination as code in the Readme that GitHub can display as pass/fail

explain how swagger and/or openapi would help

Yes, make the swagger file(s) such that I can generate the Java especially in a way that is most helpful for a Minecraft plugin using gradle and IntelliJ IDEA.

When a user copies something using worldedit, I want to send a copy to the server. When the client polls the server and finds a new paste GUID, they are notified (if it isn't in their list of received GUIDs for the current server session). There should be a command. Lets call the plugin weclipboard and the server weclipboardserver. Minecraft will automatically download the full entry for the latest dated entry, if the one currently in memory doesn't match that one's GUID. It will initially just download a list of three-element json dictionaries containing GUID, name, and date+time string per entry, but the full entry of the one with the latest datetime will be automatically downloaded and decoded into a clipboard object for worldedit and placed into the worldedit clipboard. If a user types "/weclipboard get" then a GUID, that specific one will be downloaded. Whenever you download a full clipboard entry, the automatic one or selected by GUI, the server should provide the int minX, int minY, int minZ, int maxX, int maxY, int maxZ, string datetime, and clipboard payload string, Minecraft user UUID, and name (defaults to blank). Therefore all of that has to be uploaded as well: If a user saves a schematic file using a worldedit command, the filename is placed in the name field, otherwise name is blank. Both the copy to clipboard and save schem commands should upload a clipboard entry with the user's UUID in the UUID field.

Only a whitelist of server IP addresses should be allowed to get or set data. The list endpoint should be encapsulated like {"entries": []} so that if there is a rejection based on unknown IP or other server error, the response can be {"error": "..."}. Any server error should also be shown in the get full entry scenario, and all endpoints including that should use the IP whitelist.

There should be separate IP address lists in a Go web api configuration file: {"permit": {"copy": [], "paste": [], "reload": []}}. Add a reload endpoint that triggers reloading the config file. Any other relevant configuration settings should be added to the config structure. There should be an endpoint that does a reload and only IP addresses in the "reload" list should be able to trigger it. Make sure there is a way to add localhost to each list and match up the sender reliably if the service is running on the same machine as Minecraft.

Ok ensure the design you are providing is complete like before, but with all of my latest specifications, so that I can try out the Go project and generate the Java API for weclipboard with Swagger. Also make the Minecraft bukkit server plugin code that utilizes the generated weclipboard API object(s) as well. Be sure to account for differences--perform checks and conditional code to make the plugin run on either Paper or Folia.

For the Go server program make tests with mocking, as well as platform-specific tests, GitHub actions to do platform-specific tests and build-on-release, mark pass-fail for each platform in readme, and anything else that may be helpful and best practices for a Go repo for weclipboardserver.


Now explain where to put testify test file(s), finish complete mock tests with go mock, or testify/mock if using that requires less code, unless go mock is best practice and/or works better on GitHub actions, and complete the testing for each platform, making separate files if necessary and telling me were to put the files, and  utilize those paths in the readme test status section, and in the metadata for CI and any other metadata files that would ease running tests locally.


Generate all of that, adhering to best practices.


generate the full server_test.go, mocks, and CI files that operate together correctly on GitHub CI adding any other necessary metadata files. Provide complete and working files, no ellipses nor any "implement this" type of comments.


Yes, provide the Java Swagger generation and Bukkit/Folia plugin next.


- The block above caused the LMM to generate the following prompt: Generate a complete and production-quality PHP web service project that acts as a passive relay server for synchronizing Minecraft WorldEdit clipboard data between servers, replacing existing BungeeCord or Velocity kludges. The server must provide a secure REST API for uploading and retrieving clipboard entries, saving all data with UUID, timestamp, optional description, bounding box (minX, minY, minZ, maxX, maxY, maxZ), and clipboard payload. Only whitelisted IPs may access copy, paste, or reload endpoints, and a JSON config file must hold per-endpoint IP whitelists with a reloadable structure. The API must authenticate using Mojang login session data passed by the Bukkit plugin without requiring user login; accept identity JSON passed by the plugin for validation. The system must save all clipboard uploads in historical storage with unique IDs and allow querying by latest or specific ID. The list API must only return metadata (no payload), and all responses must be wrapped in structured JSON with error fields on failure. Use best practices in modern PHP including dependency management via Composer, a solid directory layout (e.g. src/, tests/, config/), type-safe code, unit tests with mocks, and RESTful design. Integrate OpenAPI with Swagger for API documentation and for generating the corresponding Java API client that can be used in a Bukkit/Folia-compatible Minecraft plugin using Gradle and IntelliJ IDEA. Also provide the corresponding Bukkit/Folia plugin code that uses the generated Java API client to send copy/paste data and fetch clipboard lists and blobs based on GUIDs, handling auto-pull of latest entries, user UUID filtering, and clipboard hydration. Design the server and plugin so they are compatible with both Paper and Folia, using conditional logic where needed. Include full GitHub CI integration with platform-specific builds, unit test execution (via PHPUnit or equivalent), code coverage reporting, and README badges reflecting per-platform test status. Provide fully complete source files, metadata files, GitHub workflow YAMLs, and mocks with no placeholders. Use only modern, well-maintained PHP dependencies recommended by professionals, such as Slim, Symfony components, Doctrine, or similar.

- . . . Let me know if you want a specific part next or want it in order. Want to proceed with the Composer + Config setup?

Yes, go in order.

SQLite

Now do MojangSessionValidatorMock.php

What is the standard way to name the mock folder, singular, plural, and what case?

Then why are you naming it Mock in title case?

Now make the Swagger/OpenAPI spec for generating Java client object(s)

What is a standard way to save dates that is easily understood by the PHP service and easily generated from some kind of datetime object, preferably converted to text form by the generated API object(s)?

Revise and show the complete Swagger yaml file, and revise the server PHP, as follows: Every copy operation should save clipboard data to a historical table and saved to disk. The Minecraft UUID of the user initiating the operation should be stored in the table for basic control of who sees what. Store the date, and an optional description string field that may or may not be set by the web api caller. Also save a unique id. Make a web api command that lists all entries for the authenticated Minecraft UUID, showing the unique id, date, and description for each (but does not get clipboard data blob if the list command is used). A separate simple clipboard get endpoint should get the entry with the highest id unless the request specifies an id (in either case, include the data blob in the reply).
Only a whitelist of server IP addresses should be allowed to get or set data. The list endpoint should be encapsulated like {"entries": []} so that if there is a rejection based on unknown IP or other server error, the response can be {"error": "..."}. Any server error should also be shown in the get full entry scenario, and all endpoints including that should use the IP whitelist.
There should be separate IP address lists in a Go web api configuration file: {"permit": {"copy": [], "paste": [], "reload": []}}. Add a reload endpoint that triggers reloading the config file. Any other relevant configuration settings should be added to the config structure. There should be an endpoint that does a reload and only IP addresses in the "reload" list should be able to trigger it. Make sure there is a way to add localhost to each list and match up the sender reliably if the service is running on the same machine as Minecraft.

- . . . Next, I’ll generate the full Swagger YAML reflecting this behavior. Ready?

Yes

- Would you like me to scaffold the actual SQLite schema and the PHP controller logic for the clipboard database table (clipboard_history)?

Yes.

provide a full and working ClipboardController.php that meets the specifications I gave.

Now regenerate the server index.php to make sure it both provides all web API endpoint features I described, mostly sticking to the last version of the server you provided, but ensuring that it utilizes this new ClipboardController.php fully and correctly.

Ensure our authentication middleware simply requires each request to provide enough values to check with mojang's server--in other words, authenticate like the Minecraft server or one of the popular open source minecraft servers do (take a look at their code on the web if necessary), not requiring a password. Utilize a Minecraft-related PHP dependency if that is fitting, but only require that each request contains information that is readily available about the user from the perspective of a bukkit server, being both Paper or Folia compatible. Make sure you consider the code and API documentation of the open source projects Paper and Folia, and code of plugins that run on them, rather than just making stuff up or adding ellipses or "implement" comments like you sometimes do.

What would be the filename and path of this php file in this project?

Revise the server index.php file we've been working to ensure it utilizes our existing code we made for src/Config/ConfigLoader.php, src/Controllers/ClipboardController.php like you ensured in the most recent version,  plus this version of the <project-root>/src/Middleware/AuthMiddleware.php that you just provided.

You're back to using $config directly, which is fine so that it can hold various settings, but now ensure that you revise the src/Middleware/IPWhitelistMiddleware.php file to correctly respond to the way you've used it in this latest index.php code.

Create a readme for the project in markdown format. You get really confused when rendering it, mixing up which parts are markdown and which you render into html, so only provide markdown in your (ChatGPT's) code editor on the right side of yourself--do not respond with any code in chat. Use YOUR code editor I tell you--can you not understand yourself ChatGPT? I keep saying to use the code editor so you don't mangle the code, but you keep responding by placing markdown in chat, and it breaks partway through. I don't want any markdown code in chat ANY time I ask for markdown! I don't want you to format your chat words in markdown when I specifically ask for markdown. When I ask for markdown, I want you to give me a markdown FILE! A plain downloadable file, or one where I can click copy ONCE on ONE code window, which only works in your code editor! Markdown itself has code blocks, which are you to give me, but they confuse you when you try to give them to me in chat. Do not give me a code block in chat, not an html code element in chat, put the full YOUR CODE EDITOR so I can click "Copy" ONE TIME and get the whole file! Know yourself and do it! How many ways do I have to say it?

- It seems I can't generate the readme directly right now. Would you like me to guide you step-by-step on how to create it, or would you prefer I proceed with another action?

That's not true, you give me code all the time in your code editor. I'm looking at the last PHP file we discussed right now. It isn't in your chat panel, it is in your code panel. Put the entire readme code in there in markdown format.

You still didn't put it in the code editor, you ended up putting it into multiple code blocks in html once you rendered your chat. I asked you not to put it in chat.

Thank you! Now, please modify it assuming it is called weclipboardserver and located at  https://github.com/Hierosoft/weclipboardserver
